## 🎮 CONTROLLER SYSTEM CLARIFICATIONS

### ✅ **Ability Mappings Corrected**
- **Q**: Ability 1 (Basic Ability)
- **E**: Ability 2 (Basic Ability)  
- **G**: Ultimate (Character Signature Ability)
- **R**: Reserved (Currently unused)

### ✅ **Attack System Explained**
- **Attack (LMB)**: Smart targeting - Enemy players → NPCs → No attack
- **AttackNPC (RMB)**: NPC priority - NPCs → Enemy players → No attack
- **Rate Limiting**: Both respect character attack speed
- **Range Validation**: No attack if no targets in range

### ✅ **Communication System Framework**
- **Ping Wheel**: Predefined tactical callouts ("Help!", "Retreat!", etc.)
- **Code Complete**: Framework ready for UI implementation
- **Team Strategy**: Essential for competitive MOBA gameplay

### ✅ **Ability Evolution System**
- **Pokemon Unite Style**: Two upgrade paths per ability
- **Path Selection**: 1 key = Path A, 2 key = Path B
- **Strategic Depth**: Mix-and-match for character customization
