# Effective Health (eHP)

Effective health (eHP) is a metric used to compare the survivability of different characters by taking their defense into account.

## eHP Formula

`EffectiveHP = MaxHP × (1 + Defense / 600)`

Each point of defense effectively adds a fraction of the character’s maximum HP. Higher defense increases eHP, but the gains diminish because the contribution is divided by 600.

### Example

A unit with 10,000 HP and 200 defense would have an effective HP of:

`EffectiveHP = 10,000 × (1 + 200 / 600) ≈ 13,333`

This means the character effectively endures 13,333 points of incoming damage when factoring in defense.
