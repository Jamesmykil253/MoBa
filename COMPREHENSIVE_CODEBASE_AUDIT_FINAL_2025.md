#### Expert-Level Implementations

##### **Object Pool Pattern** - **Grade: A+ (95/100)**
*Reference: Game Programming Patterns, Chapter 19*

```csharp
// Thread-safe, high-performance pooling
public static class UnifiedObjectPool
{
    private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, IObjectPool> pools = 
        new ConcurrentDictionary<string, IObjectPool>();
    
    public static T Get<T>(GameObject prefab) where T : Component
    {
        var pool = GetOrCreatePool(prefab);
        return pool.Get().GetComponent<T>();
    }
}
```

**Excellence Beyond Book Recommendations:**
- ✅ **Thread Safety:** ConcurrentDictionary for high-performance access
- ✅ **Generic Interface:** Type-safe access with minimal allocation
- ✅ **Network Awareness:** Special handling for NetworkObject pooling
- ✅ **Memory Optimization:** Automatic cleanup and size management

##### **Observer Pattern** - **Grade: A (90/100)**
*Reference: Game Programming Patterns, Chapter 4; GOF Chapter 5*

```csharp
// Memory-safe observer solving book-identified memory leak problems
public class WeakEventHandler<T> : IWeakEventHandler
{
    private readonly WeakReference targetRef;
    private readonly Action<T> typedHandler;
    
    public bool IsAlive => isStatic || (targetRef?.IsAlive ?? false);
}
```

**Addresses Critical Issues from Reference Books:**
- ✅ **Memory Leak Prevention:** Weak references prevent subscriber retention
- ✅ **Performance Optimization:** Avoids reflection for type safety

// Perfect backward compatibility facade
[RequireComponent(typeof(EnhancedAbilitySystem))]
public class SimpleAbilitySystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private EnhancedAbilitySystem enhancedSystem;
    
    public bool TryCastAbility(int abilityIndex, Vector3 targetPosition, Vector3 targetDirection)
    {
        return enhancedSystem.TryCastAbility(abilityIndex, targetPosition, targetDirection);
    }
}
```

**Textbook Implementation:**
- ✅ **Clean Delegation:** Zero logic duplication
- ✅ **API Preservation:** Maintains existing prefab compatibility
- ✅ **Zero Overhead:** Direct method delegation
- ✅ **Incremental Migration:** Enables gradual system upgrades

#### Patterns Requiring Enhancement

##### **State Pattern** - **Grade: B+ (85/100)**

// Recommended improvement following Game Programming Patterns
public abstract class MovementState
{
    public abstract void Enter(MovementContext context);
    public abstract MovementState Update(MovementContext context);
    public abstract void Exit(MovementContext context);
}

public class GroundedState : MovementState { /* Complex ground logic */ }
public class AirborneState : MovementState { /* Air physics */ }
public class DashingState : MovementState { /* Dash mechanics */ }
```
