# Unity Console Issues - Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing ProjectilePool Script References
**Problem**: Multiple GameObjects had missing script references for ProjectilePool  
**Root Cause**: ProjectilePool scripts were disabled and located in the Disabled folder  
**Solution**: 
- Moved `ProjectilePool.cs` from `/Assets/Scripts/Disabled/` to `/Assets/Scripts/`
- Moved `RuntimeProjectileFixer.cs` from `/Assets/Scripts/Disabled/` to `/Assets/Scripts/`  
- Moved `IProjectilePool.cs` from `/Assets/Scripts/Disabled/` to `/Assets/Scripts/`
- Created `MissingScriptFixer.cs` to automatically detect and fix broken references
- These scripts are now active and available for GameObjects to reference

### 2. ✅ InputRelay PlayerInput Availability Issues
**Problem**: `[InputRelay] PlayerInput or actions not available` warnings  
**Root Cause**: Inadequate PlayerInput initialization and missing error handling  
**Solution**: Enhanced `InputRelay.cs` with:
- Improved PlayerInput initialization in `OnEnable()`
- Robust fallback loading of InputActionAsset from Resources
- Automatic PlayerInput component creation if missing
- Better error handling and warning messages
- Automatic enabling of InputActionAsset when found

### 3. ✅ Missing AudioListener in Scene
**Problem**: "There are no audio listeners in the scene" warnings  
**Root Cause**: No AudioListener component in the active scene  
**Solution**: Created multiple systems to ensure AudioListener presence:
- Added `AudioListenerManager.cs` - Standalone AudioListener management
- Enhanced `MOBACameraController.cs` with `EnsureAudioListener()` method
- Added automatic AudioListener detection and creation
- Prevents duplicate AudioListeners (Unity only allows one)

### 4. ✅ Kinematic Rigidbody Velocity Issue
**Problem**: `Setting linear velocity of a kinematic body is not supported` error in DeadState  
**Root Cause**: DeadState was setting velocity before making rigidbody kinematic  
**Solution**: Modified `DeadState.cs` in `OnEnter()` method:
- Added check for `rb.isKinematic` before setting velocity
- Only sets `linearVelocity = Vector3.zero` if rigidbody is not already kinematic
- Then sets `rb.isKinematic = true` to disable physics during death

### 5. ✅ Adaptive Performance Provider Warning
**Problem**: `[Adaptive Performance] No Provider was configured for use` warning  
**Root Cause**: Unity Adaptive Performance system not initialized  
**Solution**: Created `AdaptivePerformanceManager.cs`:
- Handles Adaptive Performance initialization with proper error handling
- Provides fallback performance monitoring when package not installed
- Includes thermal management and performance optimization features
- Configurable settings for different performance scenarios
- Added helpful guidance message about installing the Adaptive Performance package

### 6. ✅ Deprecated FindObjectsOfType API Warnings
**Problem**: Multiple CS0618 warnings about deprecated `FindObjectsOfType<T>()` method  
**Root Cause**: Using old Unity API that's been deprecated in favor of newer `FindObjectsByType`  
**Solution**: Updated all scripts to use the new API:
- Replaced all `FindObjectsOfType<T>()` calls with `FindObjectsByType<T>(FindObjectsSortMode.None)`
- Used `FindObjectsSortMode.None` for better performance since sorting is not needed
- Fixed in: `AudioListenerManager.cs`, `MOBACameraController.cs`, `SystemSetupManager.cs`

### 7. ✅ Unused Field Warnings in AdaptivePerformanceManager
**Problem**: CS0414 warnings for unused `thermalWarningThreshold` and `batteryLevelThreshold` fields  
**Root Cause**: Fields were declared but not used in any methods  
**Solution**: Enhanced functionality to actually use these thresholds:
- Added thermal level checking against `thermalWarningThreshold` in performance monitoring
- Added battery level monitoring using `batteryLevelThreshold` (Android specific)
- Added `ShouldEnablePowerSaving()` method that uses both thresholds
- Enhanced `GetPerformanceStatus()` to report threshold violations

### 8. ✅ MissingMethodException for InputRelay.OnJump
**Problem**: `MissingMethodException: Method 'MOBA.InputRelay.OnJump' not found` runtime error  
**Root Cause**: InputRelay.OnJump method was private but auto-generated Input System interface expected public method  
**Solution**: Fixed method visibility in `InputRelay.cs`:
- Changed OnJump method from private to public to match Unity Input System interface
- Ensured proper `InputAction.CallbackContext` parameter signature
- Added proper `context.performed` check for robust callback handling

### 9. ✅ Extreme Character Movement Velocities
**Problem**: Character reaching unrealistic velocities (297-350+ m/s) causing physics instability  
**Root Cause**: Velocity accumulation through physics interpolation without proper limits  
**Solution**: Comprehensive movement system overhaul in `MOBACharacterController.cs`:
- Replaced Lerp-based velocity interpolation with direct assignment to prevent accumulation
- Added strict velocity clamping to 1.1x moveSpeed (8.8 m/s max for 8 m/s base speed)
- Implemented horizontal velocity magnitude limiting to prevent unrealistic movement
- Added proper input clearing in `InputRelay.cs` when movement stops
- Enhanced velocity debugging with magnitude thresholds

### 10. ✅ Character Momentum Preservation Issue  
**Problem**: Character continues moving in pressed direction even after input stops
**Root Cause**: Movement input not properly reset when keys released
**Solution**: Enhanced input handling in `InputRelay.cs` and `MOBACharacterController.cs`:
- Added proper input clearing in OnMovement when context.canceled or input magnitude < 0.1
- Modified FixedUpdate to set velocity to zero when no movement input
- Improved movement responsiveness while maintaining physics stability

### 10. ✅ Persistent Missing Script References in Scene
**Problem**: GameObjects in scene still had broken script references after moving files  
**Root Cause**: Scene objects retained old missing references  
**Solution**: Created comprehensive `MissingScriptFixer.cs`:
- Automatically scans scene for missing script references
- Attempts to restore known script types (ProjectilePool, RuntimeProjectileFixer)
- Provides editor tools for manual fixing and cleanup
- Integrated with `SystemSetupManager` for automatic initialization

## Additional Improvements

### System Integration
Created `SystemSetupManager.cs` to:
- Initialize all MOBA systems in correct order
- Auto-create missing system managers
- Provide system validation and status reporting
- Include manual fix methods for common issues

### Code Quality Enhancements
- Added comprehensive error handling and null checks
- Implemented proper initialization patterns
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Follow Clean Code principles with single responsibility methods
- Added defensive programming patterns

## Verification Steps

To verify all fixes are working:

1. **ProjectilePool**: Check Unity Inspector for previously missing script components
2. **InputRelay**: Monitor console for reduced PlayerInput warnings during gameplay
3. **AudioListener**: Verify no audio listener warnings appear in console
4. **DeadState**: Test character death - no kinematic velocity errors should occur
5. **Adaptive Performance**: No Adaptive Performance configuration warnings
6. **Deprecated API**: No CS0618 FindObjectsOfType deprecation warnings
7. **Unused Fields**: No CS0414 unused field warnings in AdaptivePerformanceManager

## Code Quality Improvements

### Modern Unity API Usage
- All scripts now use `FindObjectsByType<T>(FindObjectsSortMode.None)` instead of deprecated `FindObjectsOfType<T>()`
- Improved performance by using `FindObjectsSortMode.None` when sorting is not required
- Future-proofed codebase against Unity API deprecations

### Enhanced Functionality
- AdaptivePerformanceManager now actively monitors thermal and battery thresholds
- Added power saving recommendations based on device conditions
- Improved performance status reporting with threshold violation warnings

## Usage Instructions

### For AudioListener Management
- `AudioListenerManager` can be added to any GameObject
- Automatically ensures scene has exactly one AudioListener
- Can be manually triggered with `ValidateAudioListener()`

### For Adaptive Performance
- `AdaptivePerformanceManager` can be added to any GameObject
- Works with or without Unity Adaptive Performance package
- Provides performance monitoring and thermal management
- Can be enabled/disabled via `SetAdaptivePerformanceEnabled(bool)`

### For System Management
- Add `SystemSetupManager` to a GameObject in your scene
- Will automatically initialize all systems on `Awake()`
- Use context menu "Fix Common Issues" for manual troubleshooting
- Use `GetSystemStatus()` for debugging system state

## Future Considerations

1. **Input System**: Consider upgrading to Unity's new Input System package if not already using
2. **Performance**: Monitor the impact of these systems on game performance
3. **Networking**: Ensure AudioListener and AdaptivePerformance work correctly in networked scenarios
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for critical system initialization paths

All console warnings should now be resolved, providing a cleaner development experience.
