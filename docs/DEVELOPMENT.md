- **Memory Profiling**: <512MB peak usage validation
- **Network Stress Testing**: High-latency scenario simulation
- **Battery Impact Assessment**: Mobile power consumption monitoring

## Code Quality Standards

### SOLID Principles Implementation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes are substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on methods they use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Code Style Guidelines
- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods/variables
- **Documentation**: XML comments for public APIs
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch only where necessary, prefer guard clauses
- **Performance**: Avoid allocations in Update(), use object pooling

### Error-Free Code Guarantee
All code provided must be carefully checked for syntax errors, logical errors, or omissions. The development team should mentally simulate or "dry-run" the code to ensure it would compile and run correctly if copied. This includes:
- Verifying types, boundary conditions, and null checks
- Including necessary library imports and namespace declarations
- Handling edge cases and potential exceptions
- Ensuring code follows the project's architectural patterns

### Internal Testing & Review for Code Quality Assurance
Before committing code, perform rigorous internal verification:
1. **Plan the solution approach**: Choose appropriate algorithms or API usage
2. **Dry-run walkthrough**: Simulate code execution with typical and edge-case inputs
3. **Verify logic correctness**: Check each part for potential bugs or race conditions
4. **Ensure idiomatic code**: Use language-specific best practices (e.g., LINQ in C#, list comprehensions in Python)
5. **Performance review**: Identify potential bottlenecks or memory leaks
6. **Security assessment**: Check for common vulnerabilities and secure coding practices

### Multi-Language Formatting and Clarity
When providing code examples across different programming languages:
- Use triple backticks with language specification: ```csharp, ```python, ```javascript, etc.
- Include brief comments for complex sections or important notes
- Separate code blocks clearly when solutions involve multiple languages or files
- Label code blocks with descriptive headers (e.g., "C# Script: PlayerController.cs", "Python Utility: data_processor.py")

### Project/Environment Setup Notes
For coding tasks requiring specific environments:
- **Unity Projects**: Specify Unity version (6000.0.56f1 LTS), required packages, and platform targets
- **Dependencies**: List required libraries, frameworks, or external tools
- **Configuration**: Include necessary setup steps, environment variables, or configuration files
- **Platform Requirements**: Note OS-specific requirements or compatibility considerations

### Modern and Secure Practices Across All Languages
- **Avoid deprecated APIs**: Use current best practices and officially recommended methods
- **Security-first approach**: Implement input validation, parameterized queries, and secure defaults
- **Performance optimization**: Prefer efficient algorithms and data structures
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Write code that works across target platforms
- **Accessibility considerations**: Include features for diverse user needs

### Ethical and Inclusive Coding Guidelines
- **Bias-free code**: Avoid assumptions based on demographics or cultural biases
- **Inclusive examples**: Use diverse, representative examples in documentation
- **Privacy respect**: Handle user data responsibly and transparently
- **Accessibility support**: Implement features for users with disabilities
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Consider global audience and cultural differences

### Tone and Explanation Guidelines for Coding Tasks
- **Professional and educational**: Write as an experienced developer advising a colleague
- **Direct and authoritative**: Provide solutions confidently without unnecessary apologies
- **Educational explanations**: Include reasoning behind design decisions and trade-offs
- **Practical focus**: Emphasize real-world applicability and best practices
- **Clear communication**: Use technical terminology appropriately for the target audience

### Multi-Language Code Examples
Provide examples demonstrating best practices across major programming languages:

**C# (Unity/Game Development)**:
```csharp
// Example: Efficient object pooling for projectiles
public class ProjectilePool : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Queue<GameObject> pool = new Queue<GameObject>();
    private GameObject prefab;
    private int initialSize = 20;

    void Awake()
    {
        prefab = Resources.Load<GameObject>("Projectile");
        for (int i = 0; i < initialSize; i++)
        {
            GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab);
            obj.SetActive(false);
            pool.Enqueue(obj);
        }
    }

    public GameObject GetProjectile()
    {
        GameObject projectile;
        if (pool.Count > 0)
        {
            projectile = pool.Dequeue();
        }
        else
        {
            projectile = Instantiate(prefab);
        }
        projectile.SetActive(true);
        return projectile;
    }

    public void ReturnProjectile(GameObject projectile)
    {
        projectile.SetActive(false);
        pool.Enqueue(projectile);
    }
}
```

**Python (Data Processing/AI)**:
```python
# Example: Efficient data processing with list comprehensions
def process_player_stats(raw_data: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, float]]:
    """
    Process raw player statistics with validation and normalization.

    Args:
        raw_data: List of dictionaries containing player statistics

    Returns:
        List of processed and validated statistics
    """
    return [
        {
            'player_id': player['id'],
            'win_rate': max(0.0, min(1.0, player.get('wins', 0) / max(player.get('games', 1), 1))),
            'avg_score': player.get('total_score', 0) / max(player.get('games', 1), 1),
            'skill_rating': calculate_skill_rating(player)
        }
        for player in raw_data
        if validate_player_data(player)
    ]

def validate_player_data(player: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """Validate player data structure and values."""
    required_fields = ['id', 'wins', 'games', 'total_score']
    return all(field in player for field in required_fields) and player['games'] >= 0
```

**JavaScript/Node.js (Web Services)**:
```javascript
// Example: Secure API endpoint with input validation
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

// Input validation middleware
const validatePlayerUpdate = [
    body('playerId').isUUID().withMessage('Invalid player ID format'),
    body('score').isInt({ min: 0, max: 1000000 }).withMessage('Score must be between 0 and 1,000,000'),
    body('level').isInt({ min: 1, max: 100 }).withMessage('Level must be between 1 and 100')
];

// Secure player update endpoint
router.put('/players/:id', validatePlayerUpdate, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Check for validation errors
        const errors = validationResult(req);
        if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
            return res.status(400).json({
                success: false,
                errors: errors.array()
            });
        }

        const { playerId, score, level } = req.body;
        const playerIdFromParams = req.params.id;

        // Verify player ID matches
        if (playerId !== playerIdFromParams) {
            return res.status(400).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'Player ID mismatch'
            });
        }

        // Update player with secure query
        const result = await updatePlayerSecurely(playerId, score, level);

        if (result.success) {
            res.json({
                success: true,
                message: 'Player updated successfully',
                data: result.player
            });
        } else {
            res.status(404).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'Player not found'
            });
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Player update error:', error);
        res.status(500).json({
            success: false,
            message: 'Internal server error'
        });
    }
});

module.exports = router;
```
