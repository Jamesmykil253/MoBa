# Product Vision

## Goals
1. **Create a viral satirical MOBA** that combines technopunk memes with competitive 2D platformer mechanics
2. **Establish sustainable F2P revenue** through affordable cosmetics ($1-$5) and high engagement
3. **Build competitive esports foundation** with deterministic gameplay and spectator tools
4. **Capture short attention spans** with multiple match lengths (60s-10min)

## Non-Goals
- Traditional MOBA complexity (no items, simplified roles)
- Premium character unlocks (all gameplay content free)
- Console-first design (mobile-first, PC day-1)
- AAA production values (stylized art over photorealism)
