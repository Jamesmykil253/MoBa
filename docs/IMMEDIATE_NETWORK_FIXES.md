3. **Invalid Network Prefabs** (Critical - needs fixing)
4. **Camera Working Correctly** ✅ (Good news!)

## 🛠️ Quick Fix Instructions

### Fix 1: Network Prefab Duplicates (Most Important)

```
1. In Unity Project window, find "DefaultNetworkPrefabs.asset"
2. Right-click → Delete
3. Unity will regenerate it automatically
4. Press Play to test
```

**Option B: Manual Cleanup**
```
1. Select "DefaultNetworkPrefabs.asset" in Project window
2. In Inspector, you'll see a list of prefabs
3. Remove duplicate entries (you'll see the same prefab listed multiple times)
4. Keep only unique prefabs
```

**Option C: Use My Clean Version**
```
1. In Project window, find "DefaultNetworkPrefabs_Clean.asset"
2. Right-click → Rename to "DefaultNetworkPrefabs.asset"
3. Replace the old one when prompted
```

### Fix 2: Adaptive Performance Warning (Optional)

**To Remove the Warning:**
```
1. Edit → Project Settings
2. XR Plug-in Management → Adaptive Performance
3. Uncheck "Initialize Adaptive Performance on Startup"
4. Warning will disappear
```

### Fix 3: Add Network Validation Tool

**Add to Your Scene:**
```
1. Create empty GameObject → "NetworkValidator"
2. Add Component → Scripts → Testing → Network Validator
3. Click "Validate Network Setup" to check everything
4. Click "Generate Network Setup Report" for detailed info
```

## ✅ Expected Results After Fixes

### Console Should Show:
```
[CAMERA] Initialized - Target: MOBA_Player, Distance: 12.0m ✅
[NetworkValidator] ✅ Found 1 NetworkManager(s) ✅
[NetworkValidator] ✅ Network prefabs check complete ✅
[NetworkValidator] ✅ MOBA Camera Controller found ✅
```

### Console Should NOT Show:
```
❌ NetworkPrefab duplicate GlobalObjectIdHash (FIXED)
❌ Removing invalid prefabs (FIXED)
❌ Adaptive Performance warnings (FIXED if you disabled it)
```

## 🎮 Test Your Fixes

### Step 1: Apply Fixes
1. Delete DefaultNetworkPrefabs.asset (Unity regenerates)
2. Disable Adaptive Performance (optional)
3. Add NetworkValidator to scene

### Step 2: Test
1. Press Play in Unity
2. Check Console for clean startup
3. Test WASD movement
4. Verify camera follows player

### Step 3: Validate
1. Click NetworkValidator → "Validate Network Setup"
2. Should see all ✅ green checkmarks
3. No error messages in Console

## 🎊 Success Indicators

**You'll know it's working when:**
- ✅ No red errors in Console during startup
- ✅ Camera message shows "Initialized - Target: MOBA_Player"
- ✅ NetworkValidator shows all green checkmarks
- ✅ WASD movement works smoothly
- ✅ No duplicate hash errors
- ✅ No invalid prefab warnings

## 📋 If Issues Persist

**Check These:**
1. **NetworkManager exists** - Look for it in Hierarchy
2. **Network prefabs have NetworkObject component**
3. **No duplicate prefabs in Network Prefabs list**
4. **Unity Netcode package properly installed**

**Use the NetworkValidator:**
- It will tell you exactly what's wrong
- Provides specific recommendations
- Generates detailed reports
