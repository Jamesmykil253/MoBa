## UI Component Architecture

### UI Architecture Patterns (Based on Game Programming Patterns)

**Technical Implementation:** See [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md) for complete pattern implementations including Observer, Command, Flyweight, and Object Pool patterns used throughout the UI system.

**Cross-Reference:** For input handling patterns, see [CONTROLS.md - Input System Architecture](CONTROLS.md#input-system-architecture).

#### UI Pattern Overview
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separation of UI data, presentation, and control logic
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven UI updates via UINotificationCenter  
- **Command Pattern**: Undoable UI actions and input handling
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Memory-efficient UI element sharing
- **Object Pool Pattern**: UI component reuse for performance
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple UI rendering strategies per platform

#### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern Implementation

**Complete Implementation:** See [TECHNICAL.md - Component Architecture](TECHNICAL.md#component-architecture) for full MVC implementation examples with CharacterUIModel, HealthBarView, and CharacterUIController classes.

**UI-Specific Benefits:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic separated from game logic
- **Testability**: UI components can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Changes to UI don't affect underlying game systems
- **Reusability**: UI models can be shared across different views

#### Command Pattern for UI Actions

**Complete Implementation:** See [TECHNICAL.md - Command Pattern](TECHNICAL.md#command-pattern-for-input-and-abilities) for detailed command interfaces and UI command management systems.
