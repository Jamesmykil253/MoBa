# IMMEDIATE GAMEPLAY FIX - QUICK SETUP

## üöÄ URGENT: Apply These Fixes Now

Your MOBA player is experiencing **4 critical issues** that I've just fixed:

1. ‚ùå **Player dying immediately on scene start**
2. ‚ùå **Attack projectiles spawning from camera instead of player**  
3. ‚ùå **Movement input not working (WASD not moving player)**
4. ‚ùå **Stuck in endless death/attack loop**

## ‚ö° INSTANT FIX (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Add the Fixer Component
1. In Unity, **create an empty GameObject** in your scene (right-click in Hierarchy ‚Üí Create Empty)
2. Name it "GameplayFixer"
3. Select it and **Add Component** ‚Üí Search for `GameplayIssuesFixer`
4. **Check "Fix On Start"** in the inspector
5. **Check "Debug Mode"** to see real-time status

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. **Press Play** in Unity
2. Wait 0.5 seconds for auto-fix to apply
3. **You should see green ‚úÖ messages** in the console
4. **Test immediately**:
   - **WASD** = Player should move smoothly
   - **Left Mouse** = Projectiles should spawn from player and fly forward
   - **Mouse Move** = Camera should rotate (already working)
   - **Player Health** = Should show 1000/1000 and NOT die automatically

## üîß If Automatic Fix Doesn't Work

### Manual Fix Option 1: Context Menu
1. Right-click on the `GameplayIssuesFixer` component
2. Click **"Apply All Fixes"**

### Manual Fix Option 3: Individual Fixes
Right-click the component and choose:
- **"Fix Health Only"** - Stops death loop
- **"Fix Movement Only"** - Enables WASD movement  
- **"Fix Projectiles Only"** - Fixes attack spawning
