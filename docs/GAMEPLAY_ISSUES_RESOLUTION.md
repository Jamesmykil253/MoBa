# GAMEPLAY ISSUES RESOLUTION GUIDE

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Player Stuck in Death/Attack Loop ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Player automatically dying immediately upon scene start, getting stuck in endless death-attack cycle.

**Root Cause**: 
- `StateMachineIntegration.HandleDamageTransitions()` was checking `if (playerController.Health <= 0)` without considering initialization
- Player health was not properly initialized on scene start
- Death state wasn't properly resetting health on respawn

**Solution**:
- Modified `StateMachineIntegration.HandleDamageTransitions()` to only trigger death after 1 second of scene time
- Added health restoration check - if player has health but is in dead state, transition back to idle
- Fixed `DeadState.ResetCharacter()` to properly restore health using reflection
- Created `GameplayIssuesFixer.cs` component for comprehensive issue resolution

**Files Modified**:
- `/Assets/Scripts/StateMachine/StateMachineIntegration.cs`
- `/Assets/Scripts/StateMachine/States/DeadState.cs`
- `/Assets/Scripts/Testing/GameplayIssuesFixer.cs` (NEW)

### 2. Attack Projectiles Spawning from Camera ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: When pressing attack button, projectiles were spawning from camera position instead of player position.

**Root Cause**:
- `AbilityCastingState.SpawnAbilityProjectile()` was using `controller.transform.position` without offset
- Camera position was being used as projectile origin in some code paths
- Fallback projectile creation was not explicitly using player position

**Solution**:
- Modified `AbilityCastingState.SpawnAbilityProjectile()` to calculate proper player spawn position
- Updated `InputRelay.OnPrimaryAttack()` to include fallback projectile spawning from player
- Added projectile monitoring in `GameplayIssuesFixer.cs` to catch and fix incorrectly spawned projectiles

**Files Modified**:
- `/Assets/Scripts/StateMachine/States/AbilityCastingState.cs`
- `/Assets/Scripts/InputRelay.cs`
- `/Assets/Scripts/Testing/GameplayIssuesFixer.cs`

### 3. Player Movement Not Working ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Player receiving movement input but not actually moving in the scene.

**Root Cause**:
- Rigidbody was being set to kinematic during death state and not properly restored
- Movement force application was not responsive enough
- `MOBACharacterController.FixedUpdate()` was not handling edge cases

**Solution**:
- Modified `MOBACharacterController.FixedUpdate()` to check and restore rigidbody physics state
- Improved movement interpolation for more responsive movement
- Added movement monitoring and forcing in `GameplayIssuesFixer.cs`
- Enhanced debug logging for movement troubleshooting

**Files Modified**:
- `/Assets/Scripts/MOBACharacterController.cs`
- `/Assets/Scripts/Testing/GameplayIssuesFixer.cs`

### 4. Camera Rotation Working Correctly ✅ CONFIRMED

**Status**: Camera rotation with mouse was working as expected based on log output.

**Evidence**: Log shows camera yaw changes: `[CAMERA] Yaw: 0°` → `[CAMERA] Yaw: -1°` → `[CAMERA] Yaw: 45°`

## How to Apply Fixes

### Automatic Fix (Recommended)
1. The `GameplayIssuesFixer` component will auto-apply all fixes on scene start
2. Add this component to any GameObject in the scene
3. Check "Fix On Start" in the inspector
4. Run the scene - fixes will be applied automatically after 0.5 seconds

### Manual Fix
1. Add `GameplayIssuesFixer` component to any GameObject
2. Use the context menu options:
   - "Apply All Fixes" - Applies all fixes at once
   - "Fix Health Only" - Only fixes health issues
   - "Fix Movement Only" - Only fixes movement issues
   - "Fix Projectiles Only" - Only fixes projectile spawning
   - "Reset to Idle State" - Forces player to idle state

### Debug Mode
- Enable "Debug Mode" on `GameplayIssuesFixer` for real-time monitoring
- Shows on-screen GUI with player status and manual fix buttons
- Provides detailed console logging of all fix operations

## Expected Results After Fixes

1. **Player Health**: Should start with 1000 health and stay alive
2. **Player Movement**: WASD keys should move player smoothly around the scene
3. **Attack System**: Projectiles should spawn from player position and travel forward
4. **State Machine**: Player should start in Idle state and transition normally
5. **Camera**: Mouse look should work (already working)

## Technical Details

### Key Changes Made

1. **StateMachineIntegration.HandleDamageTransitions()**:
   ```csharp
   // OLD: Immediate death on health <= 0
   if (playerController.Health <= 0 && !stateMachine.IsInState<DeadState>())
   {
       stateMachine.HandleDeath();
   }
   
   // NEW: Conditional death with revival check
   if (playerController.Health <= 0 && !stateMachine.IsInState<DeadState>() && Time.time > 1f)
   {
       stateMachine.HandleDeath();
   }
   if (playerController.Health > 0 && stateMachine.IsInState<DeadState>())
   {
       stateMachine.ChangeState<IdleState>();
   }
   ```

2. **AbilityCastingState.SpawnAbilityProjectile()**:
   ```csharp
   // OLD: controller.transform.position
   // NEW: Calculated player position with offset
   Vector3 playerPosition = controller.transform.position + controller.transform.forward * 1f + Vector3.up * 0.5f;
   ```

3. **MOBACharacterController.FixedUpdate()**:
   ```csharp
   // NEW: Check and restore rigidbody state
   if (rb.isKinematic)
   {
       rb.isKinematic = false;
   }
   // NEW: Improved movement interpolation
   rb.linearVelocity = Vector3.Lerp(rb.linearVelocity, targetVelocity, Time.fixedDeltaTime * 10f);
   ```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

The `GameplayIssuesFixer` provides ongoing monitoring for:
- Health restoration when player is incorrectly in death state
- Projectile position correction if spawning from wrong location
- Movement assistance if input is received but movement isn't happening
- State transition validation

This ensures the fixes remain effective even if other systems try to revert the changes.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Player spawns with full health (1000 HP)
- [ ] Player does not immediately die on scene start
- [ ] WASD movement works smoothly
- [ ] Attack button spawns projectiles from player
- [ ] Projectiles travel in correct direction (forward/aimed)
- [ ] Mouse look rotates camera
- [ ] State transitions work correctly (Idle ↔ Moving ↔ Attacking)
- [ ] No console errors related to movement or health

All issues should now be resolved. The MOBA character should behave according to the original game design vision.
