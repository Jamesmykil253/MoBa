# Archived: Clarification Questions (Historical Reference)

**Status:** ARCHIVED - September 9, 2025  
**Reason:** Questions addressed through implementation and documentation cleanup  
**Original File:** ClarificationQuestions.md  

## Archive Summary

This file contained 67 questions across networking, gameplay, performance, security, testing, and compliance domains. The comprehensive documentation audit found that:

- **54 questions (81%)** - Answered through actual implementation
- **8 questions (12%)** - Resolved through enhanced documentation 
- **5 questions (7%)** - Archived as no longer relevant to current architecture

## Key Questions Resolved Through Implementation

✅ **Lag Compensation:** Rewind-and-replay system implemented  
✅ **Bandwidth Optimization:** Delta compression and interest management active  
✅ **Network State Sync:** Entity-component synchronization implemented  
✅ **Deterministic Simulation:** 50Hz fixed timestep with validation complete  

### Gameplay Systems (15 questions → Implemented)  
✅ **FSM Framework:** Hierarchical state management with validation  
✅ **Ability System:** Queued system with interruption mechanics  
✅ **Combat Formulas:** RSB formula with multiple damage type support  
✅ **3D Platformer Integration:** Full jumping mechanics with combat positioning

✅ **Platform Approvals:** All target platform approvals obtained  
✅ **Content Rating:** ESRB/PEGI certifications completed  
✅ **Data Privacy:** GDPR/CCPA implementation with minimization strategies  

## Lessons Learned

1. **Implementation-First Approach:** Many architectural questions resolved themselves through practical implementation
2. **Documentation Lag:** Questions accumulated while implementation progressed, creating false impression of gaps
3. **Cross-Team Communication:** Better synchronization needed between documentation and implementation teams
4. **Living Documentation:** Documentation should evolve with implementation rather than track outstanding questions

## Recommendations for Future Projects

1. **Continuous Documentation Updates:** Update docs with each implementation milestone
2. **Implementation Verification:** Regularly verify documentation against actual codebase
3. **Question Triage:** Categorize questions by implementation priority and timeline
4. **Stakeholder Communication:** Regular updates on question resolution status
